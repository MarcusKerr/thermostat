# Thermostat

### Week 5 pairing assignment - Introduction to JavaScript

## Goals

* I can learn new languages quickly
* I wrote code that is easy to change
* I know how my language works
* I can build web apps
* I can test-drive my code

During this project, I was taked with learning a new language in a short period of time in order to produce a product. I completed the first 4 user stories during pairing sessions and completed the remainder of the project alone.

## How to use

## Specification

Specification:

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an up function
* You can decrease the temperature with a down function
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
* You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is `low-usage`, < 25 is `medium-usage`, anything else is `high-usage`.
* (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
